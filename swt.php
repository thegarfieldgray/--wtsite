The duration of a participant’s programme may be shortened; depending on the school’s official summer break. It is our responsibility to provide you with a legitimate job and a programme sponsor while you are in the USA. Your role is to provide all that is required, follow all the rules and you will be on your way to having a great programme.

				It allows you to create a network of international friends and employers. At the end of the summer you are most likely to gain a worthwhile experience and will also internationalize your resume.
				You will also earn money to take care of your expenses while you are in the USA, traveling and sightseeing at the end of the programme.
